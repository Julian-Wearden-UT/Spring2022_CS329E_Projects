## Projects Overview
### AboutMe
A simple "about me" page to help familiarize myself with the HTML language.

### UTForm
A feedback form for a UT campus visit that served as an introduction to forms in HTML as well as buttons and divs.

### CSSPractice
Updates of AboutMe and UTForm projects with CSS.

### TheDailyClarion
A full front-page of a news site called "The Daily Clarion". This page features a navigation bar and a heavy use of CSS to layout all elements on the page.

### MortgageCalculator
An introduction to the integration of Javascript with HTML/CSS through a mortgage calculator. The page allows you to enter the principal amount, yearly interest rate, and loan term and outputs your monthly mortgage payment, sum of all payments, and total quantity paid in interest.

### AccountRegistration
A site that allows users to register an account and uses Javascript to validate username and password requirements.

### RandomGalaxies
A site that displays a random Galaxy everytime the page is refreshed. Used as further practice with Javascript and its use in programatically changing HTML/CSS elements.

### TravelShow
A site that allows the user to start/stop a slideshow with travel pictures. Used as practice calling Javascript functions from form.

### Jigsaw
A jigsaw puzzle where users can drag and drop parts of an image onto a grid, while a timer runs. When they are done, they can stop the timer to get the puzzle "graded". Practice with event listeners and user interaction.

### Signup
A signup sheet written entirely in PHP that displays a form sign-up sheet. Users enter their name and the time they would like to sign up for. Values are storred in a file called signup.txt so that information persists.

### Memory
The traditional memory game, where a user has to match two blocks that are the same. The game keeps track of how many clicks it took the user to solve the game. Uses JQuery to animate clicks and check for successful matching.

### TheDailyClarion (PHP)
An update to TheDailyClarion project that uses PHP and cookies to make sure the user is logged in before accessing certain pages.

### LoginQuiz
A full quiz that uses cookies to ensure user logs in and hasn't taken the quiz before. The quiz also does all grade checking through a seperate PHP script "on the backend" so the user can't simply inspect elements to find answers.


### StudentRecords (MySQL)
A site that helps the user interface with a MySQL database to Insert, Update, Delete, and View student records.
